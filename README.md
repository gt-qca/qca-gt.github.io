## WELCOME TO QCA!

### Our Purpose


#### Create a community of students interested in quantum computing by organizing casual social events such as lunches or recreational events

#### Connect students with resources, people, and opportunities in quantum computing, both academic and professional

#### Cultivate students' skill, interest and knowledge of quantum computing by organizing paper reading groups, discussions with professors, and quantum computing projects



### About Us

We are a student-led organization at Georgia Tech starting in Spring 2020. Georgia Tech has a lot to offer when it comes to Quantum Computing. We're here to aid the student body with learning about this subject. If you're interested in joining. Please reach out!

### Campus Resources


ROGUES GALLERY VIP TEAM
Dr. Jason Riedy and Dr. Jeff Young

Our main goal for this project is to help interface new “post-Moore” hardware like neuromorphic field-programmable analog arrays (FPAAs), quantum computing, memory-centric architectures like the Emu Chick, and tightly coupled FPGAs with current software technologies. We aim to develop easy-to-use software demonstrations and examples for each new piece of hardware in the Rogues Gallery testbed and to design strategies to extend the hardware for interesting research problems and class projects.


CHAPMAN LABS
Dr. Michael Chapman

Our research is focused on investigating the quantum behavior of atoms and photons, often at the single particle level. We employ lasers to confine and cool atoms to nano-Kelvin temperatures, which are used for studies including fundamental atom-photon interactions, atom optics and interferometry, and quantum computing and communication.
